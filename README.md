# 📊 Data Analytics Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end‑to‑end data analytics workflow, starting from loading raw data in Python, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), cleaning and transforming the dataset, running SQL queries across multiple database systems, and finally visualizing insights through a Power BI dashboard. The project concludes with a structured report .

---

## Dataset
- **Source:** Publicly available dataset (replace with actual source, e.g., Kaggle, internal data, etc.)
- **Format:** CSV/Excel (specify actual format)
- **Content:** Includes records with attributes such as [insert key features, e.g., customer demographics, transactions, sales figures].
- **Size:** [Insert number of rows/columns]

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – for data loading, EDA, and cleaning  
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server) – for querying and relational analysis  
- **Power BI** – for interactive dashboards and visualization  
- **Gamma** – for professional presentation slides  
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code** – for development and documentation

## Steps
1. **Data Loading**  
   - Import dataset into Python environment.  
   - Inspect structure and metadata.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Summary statistics, distributions, correlations.  
   - Visualizations to identify trends and anomalies.  

3. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.  
   - Standardize formats and ensure consistency.  

4. **SQL Queries**  
   - Load cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server.  
   - Run queries for aggregations, joins, and filtering.  

5. **Dashboard Creation**  
   - Import processed data into Power BI.  
   - Build interactive visuals (KPIs, charts, filters).  

6. **Reporting & Presentation**  
   - Document findings in a structured report.  
   - Create recruiter‑friendly PPT using Gamma.  

---

## Dashboard
- **KPIs:** Highlight key metrics (e.g., revenue growth, customer retention).  
- **Visuals:** Bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and interactive slicers.  
- **Interactivity:** Drill‑down filters for detailed analysis.  

---

## Results
- Clear insights into [insert domain, e.g., sales trends, customer behavior].  
- Identification of patterns and actionable recommendations.  
- Professional dashboard and presentation for stakeholders.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/priyanka0001-tech/customer_behaviour_dashboard.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:  
   ```bash
   cd data-analytics-project
   ```
3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts for EDA and cleaning.  
5. Load cleaned data into your SQL database and execute queries.  
6. Open Power BI file (`.pbix`) to explore the dashboard.
